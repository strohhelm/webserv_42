Post request

- unlike GET its not send within the URL but rather within the request itself
- Inlcudes headers like Content-Type and Content-Length
- Usually encodes it? (further reaserch needed on this)

Steps:

1. Server recieves the request (handleHttpRequest -> handlePost member functions inside the HttpRequest class)
2. Processing data in the request body
3. Required actions are performed such as saving to a database
4. Response is returned (often times a redirect or new page)

Stand out features of Post:

- Data inside the request body
- not chached in the browser
- no length limits unlike GET URL limitations
- Secure for sensible data, not visible in the URL

Most often used for:

- Form submissions
- File uploads
- Sending large ammounts of data
- Operations that shouldnt be repeatable (like buying smth)

Things to look into:

- Https en- decryption
- Implementing Size limts to avoid overload such as DoS
- CSRF protection for forms?
- Idempotency


TO DO:

- parse the body of post depending on the content type specified in the header
- validate the data for empty fields (like nothing being sent for a pw or username field)
- process data depending on the context, storing in database, comparing with database for login
- route depending on URL endpoint for example sign up or login
