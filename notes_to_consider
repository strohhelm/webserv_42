A sender send whitespace between the start-line and the first header field.
A recipient that receives whitespace between the start-line and the first header field either
reject the message as invalid or consume each whitespace-preceded line without further
processing of it (i.e., ignore the entire line, along with any subsequent lines preceded by
whitespace, until a properly formed header field is received or the header section is terminated).

--> the server should respond with a 400 (Bad Request) response and close the connection.


Recipients of an invalid request-line SHOULD respond with either a 400 (Bad Request) error or a
301 (Moved Permanently) redirect with the request-target properly encoded.

A client MUST send a Host header field ( ) in all HTTP/1.1 request messages. If
the target URI includes an authority component, then a client MUST send a field value for Host
that is identical to that authority component, excluding any userinfo subcomponent and its "@"
delimiter ( ). If the authority component is missing or undefined for the target
URI, then a client MUST send a Host header field with an empty field value.

A server MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message that
lacks a Host header field and to any request message that contains more than one Host header
field line or a Host header field with an invalid field value.


A server MUST accept the absolute-form in requests even though most HTTP/1.1 clients will only
send the absolute-form to a proxy Page 11.
