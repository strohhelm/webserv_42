methods always set to false? ajehle - at least GET could be always set to true because setting up a server without methods makes no sense ?✅
handleDelete response code

cgi ✅
dir listing ✅
errno output removen -> Error receiving data from client

default error files, checking in sendErrorResponse if there is  a default file in this server, if so send it instead of response.✅

location \.php as default cgi path or keep as is.

are all settings considered in the corresponding functoins?

return value check from send and revieve

Headers check -> some headers have to be there and cant be sent twice also-> 400 HOST check!

understand the subject!✅

checking port numbers when setting up sockets so that only the first siver on certain port in the config file will listen on that port.✅


downloadin get request has to send chunked with great files!✅


redirects✅

errorcheck in config

error logfile wrong content

setHostnamesToSystem and removeHostnamesFromSystem ✅




multiple root dir in one config works and takes last one and so does  indexes as well and listen and servernames <--- need to talk about this(andi)
(philipp):except for severnames it overwrites the values like ginx does (except nginx accumulates also the listen directive->multiple ports per server)
	server {
		listen 8081;
		server_name example1.org localhost;

		root ./www/html/multipleserver;
		root ./www/html;
		index server8081.html ;
		index server8081.html ;

		location / {
			methods GET POST DELETE;
		}
	}

defaultLocation when no location is set? << interesting (philipp)
		location / {
			methods GET POST DELETE;
		}
